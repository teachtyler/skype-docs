# Installing Skype for Business SDN Interface


_**Applies to:** Lync Server 2013 | Skype for Business 2015_

You install Microsoft Skype for Business SDN Interface by running two installation packages. One is for the SDN Manager and the other is for the Dialog Listener. The two packages are **SkypeforBusinessSDNManager.msi** and **SkypeforBusinessDialogListener.msi**.

We recommend that you run **SkypeforBusinessSDNManager.msi** before you run the **SkypeforBusinessDialogListener.msi**. This will ensure that the SDN Manager is running and ready when the Dialog Listener attempts to connect to the SDN Manager.
